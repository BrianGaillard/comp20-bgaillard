Purpose of Repository
----------------------
The purpose of this repository is to store and display my projects and applications and keep them for future opportunities.

Favorite Assignment
----------------------
My favorite Assignment was Assignment 2 because I thought it was really interesting and fun to use the Google maps API to find locations and apply it to an application.

Growth
----------------------
I believe that I have grown a lot since the beginning of the course and have gained many new and practical skills that I can use in the real world.

Most Important Thing
----------------------
The most important thing that I learned was the significance of web application security. XSS and SQL injection are just some ways that people can attack a site, and not many people leaving college have experienece in fields relating to this. Many web applications don't have sufficient protection from attacks at all.

Delve Deeper
----------------------
I would definitely like to delve deeper into cybersecurity, as I would be interested in making a web application in the future and would like to know the proper precautions to take. It also seems like a vital part of web programming, and I feel it would allow me to take my understanding of web programming to a new level.
